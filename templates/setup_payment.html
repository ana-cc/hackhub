<h2>Setup Payment</h2>

<p>We accept payments to our bank account via standing order.</p>

<p>We're still working out the exact details of how to handle these
payments. The current plan involves manually checking the accont for
incoming payments and then recording them so there will be a delay
between your payment hitting our account and that being reflected here
in hackhub. We intend to do checks of the account at least twice a
month, around the middle and end of the month.</p>

<p>Money landing in our account without a reference can't be
associated with a member so will be considered a donation. Transfers
to cover membership fees <strong>must</strong> include your username as
the reference.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>We have  <a href="/hub/so_form">a handy form</a> you can print, fill
in your details on the dotted lines and give to your bank to set up
the standing order. Please let us know if your bank has any problems
with this form and we can hopefully get them ironed out.</p>

<p>If you're setting things up without using <a href="/hub/so_form">
the handy form</a> the details you need are:</p>

<table>
<tr> 
     <td>Account name</td>
     <td>{{ bank.act_name }}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Account number</td>
  <td>{{ bank.act_number }}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Sort code</td>
  <td>{{ bank.sort_code }}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Payment reference</td>
  <td>{{ member.username }}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Payment</td>
  <td>Â£20.00 <strong>monthly</strong> on/soon after the 1st of every month</td>
</tr>
</table>
